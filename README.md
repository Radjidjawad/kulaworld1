# KulaWorld3DUnity
Kula World is a puzzle game released in 1998 for Playstation 1. The player controls a beach ball and must collect the keys distributed in the level and arrive on the exit square in order to move on to the next one (there are 210 levels in total distributed under 12 different worlds).  The main advantage of Kula World is the 3D aspect, which allows you to use all the sides of the level (the one above, the one below or the 4 sides), moreover, gravity is used and you can jump with your ball to go to different places of the level (or even fall and start the level again (except the bonus and secret levels)).
